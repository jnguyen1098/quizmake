__QUESTION__
How many times will "{string1}" print?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void)
{
    fork();
    fork();
    fork();
    puts("{string1}");
    return 0;
}
__ANSWER__
8 times
3 times
0 times
1 time
__FEEDBACK__
Correct; every instance of fork() will cause the next calls to occur twice, and the next ones to occur four times, etc; it's 2^(number of fork() calls)
How many processes are there every time fork() is called?
puts() is just as capable of printing "{string1}" as printf() is, so try again
Try again.
