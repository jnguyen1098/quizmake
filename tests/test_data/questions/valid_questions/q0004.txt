__QUESTION__
Why won't this code compile?

#include <{include1}>
#include <{include2}>
#include <{include3}>
#include <{include4}>
#include <{include5}>

int main(void)
{
    char {var1}[] = "{string}";
    printf("%s\n", {var1});
    return 0
}

__ANSWER__
The programmer forget to put a semicolon on the return
{var1} is incorrectly initialized
#include <{include3}> is breaking gcc
#include <{include4}> is breaking gcc
__FEEDBACK__
Correct.
{var1} is correctly initialized as a string
The {include3} standard library won't break anything even if not used
The {include4} standard library won't break anything even if not used
