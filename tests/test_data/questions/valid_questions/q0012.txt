Which of the following declarations refers to a pointer to a function that takes in a(n) {type1}, a(n) {type2} and returns a(n) {type3}?
[answer]
{type3} (*{var1})({type2}, {type1});
{type3} {var2}({type1}, {type2});
{type4} {var3}({type1}, {type2});
{type4} (*{var4})({type2}, {type1});

Correct. Because of the asterisk's (*) low precedence, it is important to use parentheses to ensure correct operator precedence for {var1}.
Incorrect. {var2} is just a function, not a function pointer.
Incorrect. {var3} shouldn't return {type4}.
Incorrect. Even though it *IS* a function pointer, it shouldn't return {type4}.
