__QUESTION__
Find the error in the code.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    double {var1}[] = "{string}";
    printf("%s\n", {var1});
    return 0;
}
__ANSWER__
double {var1}[] should be declared as char {var1}[] instead
There is nothing wrong with the code
You don't need to #include <stdio.h>
This program should return something other than 0
__FEEDBACK__
Yes, because we are initializing a string, we need a char array
There totally is something wrong with this code
You do. You need it to call print()
0 is actually used to successful termination, so it's fine
