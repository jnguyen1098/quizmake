Why does this program compile with warning(s)?
// COMMENT ONE

#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    double {var} = {CUSTOM.random_digit}.{CUSTOM.random_digit}{CUSTOM.random_digit};
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}

// COMMENT TWO
The programmer didn't #include <stdio.h>
The programmer should have used puts() instead
There is nothing wrong with the program
// COMMENT THREE
<stdlib.h> is deprecated (obsolete)
[feedback]
Yup, you need this to call printf()
Nope, puts() and printf() accomplish nearly the same thing in this context
// COMMENT FOUR
There certainly is something wrong with this program. Compile if you give up!
<stdlib.h> is one of the most important libraries!
