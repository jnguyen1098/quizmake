__QUESTION__
Why does this program compile with warning(s)?

#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    double {var} = {CUSTOM.random_digit}.{CUSTOM.random_digit}{CUSTOM.random_digit};
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
__ANSWER__
The programmer didn't #include <stdio.h>
The programmer should have used puts() instead
There is nothing wrong with the program
<stdlib.h> is deprecated (obsolete)
__FEEDBACK__
Yup, you need this to call printf()
Nope, puts() and printf() accomplish nearly the same thing in this context
There certainly is something wrong with this program. Compile if you give up!
<stdlib.h> is one of the most important libraries!
