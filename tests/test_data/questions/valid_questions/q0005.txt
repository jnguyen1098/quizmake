__QUESTION__
Say you want to dynamically allocate a 2D array of {type1}. Which would be the correct way to declare it?
__ANSWER__
{type1} **{var1};
{type1} {var1};
{type1} *{var1};
{type1} ***{var1};
__FEEDBACK__
Correct; you would need a pointer to a {type1} pointer.
Incorrect. This only declares a single {type1}.
Incorrect. This only creates a 1D array of {type1}.
Incorrect. This creates a whopping 3D array of {type1}.
