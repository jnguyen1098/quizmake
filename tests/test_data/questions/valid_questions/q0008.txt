This program has a big flaw in it. Would this flaw be discovered at compile-time or run-time?

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char {var1}[] = "{string1}";
    {var1}[{digit_non_zero1}{digit_non_zero2}{digit_non_zero3}] = '4';
    printf("%s\n", {var1});
    return 0;
}

Because it is undefined behaviour, we don't actually know
Run-time
Compile-time

Trick question, sorry. It depends on a few factors. The program may crash on startup, or the compiler might warn you. That's the thing about undefined behaviour: it's unpredictable.
