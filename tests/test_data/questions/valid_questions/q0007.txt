make all
make

Yes, 'clean' is customarily the name most people use for cleaning up
No, this is for running the program
No, this recipe doesn't even exist in the makefile. It would usually be used to make all of the program's object files and libraries though
No, this defaults to the first recipe, which is 'run'
